# Dragon Ball Memory Card Game

This is a Memory Card Game based on the characters of Dragon Ball Universe. To implement it I have used HTML + CSS + Javascript + React

I'm going to use [DragonBall API](https://web.dragonball-api.com) for the cards deck.

## How the game works

- You need to pick cards from a random deck without repeat the characters on it.
- There are 3 difficult levels:
	- Easy
		- 3 cards
		- Goal: 5 points
	- Medium
		- 4 cards
		- Goal: 7 points
	- Hard
		- 5 cards
		- Goal: 10 points

- The game always saves your best score on each level, unless you go to the main menu.
